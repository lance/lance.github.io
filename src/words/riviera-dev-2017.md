I returned late SundayÂ night from a trip to the south of France, where I was privileged to speak about Microservices, OpenShift, and how to do it all on Node.js. The conference was RivieraDev/JUDCon: Riviera 2017 and took place in Sophia Antipolis, near Nice, Cannes, St. Tropez and other fabulous Mediterranean cities on the southeastern coast of France.

It was gorgeous.

I blogged about it over on the
[Red Hat Developers blog](https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2017/05/17/riviera-devjudcon-riviera-2017-recap/). 
Check it out.
